This repository contains my submissions for the data analysis project. 
The scripts Kcalc.py and RainvsHeadplots.py comprise the code that I
would like evaluated. All necessary data files for executing these
scripts is contained in the repository.  
Functionality and instructions for running the scripts is detailed
in the comments of each respctive script.
